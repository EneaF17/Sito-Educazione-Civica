                <h2 class="pd5px">Latin America: Argentina</h2>
                <p class="pd5px">
                    Argentina's Congress has legalised abortions up to the 14th week of pregnancy, a ground-breaking move for a
                    region that has some of the world's most restrictive termination laws.
                    Senators voted in favour of the bill after a marathon session with 38 in favour, 29 against and one abstention.
                    Until now, abortions were only permitted in cases of rape or when the mother's health was at risk.
                    The bill had been approved by the Chamber of Deputies earlier this month.
                    The Catholic Church, which remains highly influential in Latin America, had opposed the move, calling on
                    senators to reject the bill supported by centre-left President Alberto Fernández.
                </p>
                <p class="pd5px">
                    Pro-choice activists hope the passing of the law in Argentina
                    - one of the largest and most influential countries in the
                    region - will inspire other countries to follow suit.
                    Large crowds of campaigners both for and against abortion
                    had gathered outside Congress in the capital Buenos Aires,
                    following the debate on huge screens.
                    When the vote finally happened, there was jubilation in the
                    pro-choice camp.
                </p>
                <p class="pd5px">
                    While Argentina's powerful Catholic Church, and its growing
                    evangelical community, put up strong opposition against this
                    bill, it was Argentina's mighty "green wave" women's
                    movement that has been at the forefront of this change.
                    A grassroots feminist movement that has grown in influence
                    in the past few years, its campaigning prevailed, overturning
                    a law that had been in place since 1921.
                </p>
                <p class="pd5px">
                    Activists have campaigned for a change in the law for years. The passing came two years after senators
                    narrowly voted against legalising abortion.
                    President Fernández had made reintroducing it one of his campaign promises. "I'm Catholic but I have to
                    legislate for everyone," he argued.
                    The president also said providing free and legal abortions up to the 14th week of pregnancy was a matter of
                    public health as "every year around 38,000 women" are taken to hospital due to clandestine terminations and
                    that "since the restoration of democracy [in 1983] more than 3,000 have died".
                </p>
                <h2 class="pd5px">Latin America: Chile</h2>
                <p class="pd5px">
                    Chile's LGBT community had long pushed for the legalisation of same-sex marriages, but a bill to that effect
                    languished in Congress for four years.
                    Introduced by the left-wing President Michelle Bachelet in 2017, the bill was finally pushed through by her
                    right-wing successor, Sebastian Piñera, in December 2021 - much to the shock of some of Mr Piñera's party
                    colleagues and the Catholic Church.
                    Three months on, it has finally come into effect.
                </p>
                <p class="pd5px">
                    Javier Silva and his partner Jaime Nazar were the first to get married under the new law after "getting lucky"
                    when the appointments opened up and they got the first slot.
                    Like Consuelo and Pabla, they too want to get full legal status as parents. The couple have two children,
                    20-month-old Clemente and four-month-old Lola María.
                    Jaime is the biological father of Clemente and Javier is
                    the biological father of Lola María. Both children were
                    born to a surrogate mother in Colombia.
                    The couple say they are relieved that they will now be
                    able to be legally recognised as the parents of both
                    Clemente and Lola María.
                </p>
                <p class="pd5px">
                    Javier explains that under the old rules, he would have
                    had no legal rights to Clemente if Jaime had died. All
                    rights would have automatically gone to Jaime's parents
                    as Clemente's next of kin.
                    While Javier and Jaime say they were always going to choose surrogacy, they are happy that the new law will
                    make things easier for same-sex couples looking to adopt.
                    Until now, only one of the two individuals in a same-sex partnership could adopt and hold parental legal rights
                    and responsibilities.
                </p>
                <h2 class="pd5px">Latin America: Costa Rica</h2>
                <p class="pd5px">
                    Costa Rica's historic legalization of same-sex marriage on May 26 stands out amidst a global wave of
                    conservative pushbacks against democratic values. This achievement reflects a governance model that
                    merges social inclusion with liberal institutions, rejecting populism in favour of the rule of law.
                    Despite becoming the norm in wealthier democracies, same-sex marriage remains uncommon elsewhere due
                    to widespread initial opposition. In Costa Rica, where only 28.2 percent of the population approved of gay
                    marriage in a 2014 poll. However, Costa Rica's social democrats, uncomfortable with this conservatism, rallied
                    to update state institutions to protect stigmatised sexual minorities.
                </p>
                <p class="pd5px">
                    In 2016, President Luis Guillermo Solís, despite not being a vocal supporter of equal marriage, consulted the
                    Inter-American Court of Human Rights (I.A.C.H.R.) on LGBT+ rights, which ultimately ruled in favour of
                    marriage equality. Solís, citing the supremacy of international human rights treaties, accepted the I.A.C.H.R.'s
                    recommendation, leading to the legalization of same-sex marriage.
                </p>
                <p class="pd5px">
                    This model of inclusion, rooted in the Figueres model established in the late 1940s, has transformed Costa
                    Rica into one of Latin America's most prosperous democracies. However, Solís's decision faced populist
                    backlash, particularly during the 2018 presidential election, where a conservative candidate opposed
                    same-sex marriage. Yet, voters elected a young social democrat, reaffirming the model of inclusion via legality.
                </p>
                <p class="pd5px">
                    As the May 26 deadline approached, conservative legislators attempted to postpone same-sex marriage
                    implementation, but their motion was defeated in a remarkable example of Congress standing for LGBT+
                    rights. Despite challenges, Costa Rica's commitment to a liberal democratic process prevailed, demonstrating
                    the triumph of social inclusion through legal means.
