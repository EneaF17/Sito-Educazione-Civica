                <p class="pd5px">Gov. Ralph S. Northam on Wednesday signed a
                    bill that abolished the death penalty in Virginia,
                    making it the first Southern state and the 23rd
                    overall to end capital punishment amid rising
                    opposition to the practice.
                    Before signing the bill, Mr. Northam pointed to
                    Virginia’s 413-year history of capital punishment
                    where he also noted racial disparities in the use
                    of the death penalty: During the 20th century, 79
                    percent of inmates Virginia executed for murder
                    were Black. The last two men on death row in
                    the state, both black, will now see their
                    sentences converted to life in prison without
                    parole.</p>
                <p class="pd5px clb">Virginia has executed more people than any other state except Texas since capital punishment was upheld by
                    the Supreme Court in 1976.
                    Executions are still authorised in 27 states across the country, though several have enacted a moratorium on
                    carrying the punishment out. During his presidential campaign, Joe Biden vowed to end the federal death
                    penalty and encourage states to follow suit, but has not addressed the issue as president.
                    Virginia has used the death penalty nearly 1,400 times since its days as a colony, according to the Death
                    Penalty Information Center.
                    Democrats, who control the state legislature, pushed for its repeal, arguing it had disproportionately hurt
                    people of colour, the mentally ill and the poor.
                    The United Nations says 170 of its 194 member states have abolished executions in law or practice and the
                    US has faced repeated international criticism over its failure to do so.</p>
                <h2 class="ctr">United States - Canada</h2>
                <p class="pd5px">Passed in June 2017, Bill C-16 has become part of a larger conversation surrounding gender, pronoun use,
                    freedom of speech, and the rights of transgender and gender-diverse Canadians. Bill C-16 added the words
                    “gender identity or expression” to three places.
                    - First: It was added to the Canadian Human Rights Act, joining a list of identifiable groups that are protected
                    from discrimination. These groups include age, race, sex, religion and disability, among others.
                    - Second: It was added to a section of the Criminal Code that targets hate speech where it joins other
                    identifiable groups.
                    - Third: It was added to a section of the Criminal Code dealing with sentencing for hate crimes. If there’s
                    evidence that an offence is motivated by bias, prejudice or hate, it can be taken into account by the courts
                    during sentencing.
                    The bill, which enshrines the rights of transgender or gender-diverse Canadians by including them under
                    human rights and hate-crime laws, has sparked some debate. Critics voiced concerns that the law will penalize
                    citizens who do not use specific pronouns when referring to gender diverse people.</p>
                
                <h3>Pronoun usage</h3>
                <p class="pd5px">In the Criminal Code, which does not reference pronouns, misusing pronouns alone would not constitute a
                    criminal act. The Canadian Human Rights Act (a federal act that includes the federal government itself, First
                    Nations governments, as well as federally regulated employers) does not mention pronouns either.
                    But, if someone refused to use a preferred pronoun — and it was determined to constitute discrimination or
                    harassment — that could potentially result in jail time, through a process that would start with a complaint and
                    progress to a proceeding before a human rights tribunal. If the person refused to comply with the tribunal's
                    order, this would result in a contempt proceeding being sent to the Divisional or Federal Court. The court could
                    then potentially send a person to jail until they purge the contempt.
                    Since the changes brought forth by Bill C-16 do not mention pronouns, they are contained in a 2014 policy
                    released by the Ontario Human Rights Commission (OHRC) for guidance.</p>
