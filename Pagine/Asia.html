                <h2 class="ctr">Caste-based discrimination on Dalits</h2>
                <p class="pd5px">In Nepal there was a historic sentence against discrimination on caste grounds: on 5
                    December the District Court of West Rikum sentenced 26 defendants, 24 of them to life imprisonment,
                    for the murder of six young people belonging to the oppressed caste of Dalits.</p>
                <p class="pd5px">The serious event of blood had occurred in May 2020: a crowd of troublemakers belonging
                    to a dominant caste had accused a Dalit of having an affair with a girl from their group. They had
                    retaliated by brutally killing the man and five other Dalits and seriously injuring 13 more.</p>
                <p class="pd5px">Although caste discrimination is prohibited by the Constitution and a specific law of
                    2011, Dalits continue to suffer discrimination. Sometimes their complaints are not even recorded.
                    The judgment of December 5 may finally set a precedent for changing things.</p>
                <p class="pd5px">In Nepal there are between 3.6 and 5 million people with this status, which means that
                    they could comprise up to a fifth of the total population.</p>
                <p class="pd5px">There are 3 subgroups of this caste: those living in the hilly regions, the inhabitants
                    of the mountains and the Madeshi Dalits of Terai, a lowland region in the south that extends into
                    northern India. Within their community many have legally changed their surname to make it seem like
                    they belong to a more privileged caste as a last attempt to alleviate the discrimination they face
                    so often.</p>
                <p class="pd5px">Caste-based discrimination within the Dalit community represents a great challenge in
                    the fight against casteism. In Nepal discrimination within this caste is so profound that it has a
                    different social status.</p>
                <p class="pd5px">Although the Nepalese constitution clearly states that caste discrimination is a
                    punishable offense in the country, it is still deep within the Dalit and non-Dadalit people, as well
                    as within their own community.</p>
                <p class="pd5px">Religious conversions are illegal in Nepal, but the numbers suggest that many consider
                    it a risk worth taking. Here religions such as Hinduism, Buddhism, Islam, Christianity and Bon are
                    practiced. 65% of the Christian population, for example, come from the Dalit community, since they
                    became aware of the injustices suffered by the oppressive Hindu caste system.</p>
                <p class="pd5px">Their women are considered even worse and are often victims of human trafficking. </p>
                <p class="pd5px">After the abolition of the monarchy, the Nepalese people had high hopes from political
                    parties. The Constituent Assembly has repeatedly failed to enact the new constitution, which was
                    eventually promulgated in 2015 causing violent protests. </p>
                <p class="pd5px">The caste system is still deeply rooted in the country’s culture.</p>

                <h2 class="ctr">Gay rights in Mongolia</h2>
                <p class="pd5px">In 2017, changes were made to the law to provide more protections for the LGBT
                    community as well as better training for law enforcement officials on hate crimes and preventing and
                    prosecuting them.</p>
                <p class="pd5px">The LGBT Center, a Mongolian NGO, began training the police on hate crimes and the
                    implications of the 2017 criminal code after they failed to take action against an officer who
                    assaulted a detained transgender woman.They have since trained more than 500 police officers,
                    prosecutors, and judges.Now, the Mongolian police force has guidelines for dealing with transgender
                    people, and officers are trained to treat them according to the gender they identify as, regardless
                    of their state-issued identification. </p>
                <p class="pd5px">Following Bosoo Khukh Mongol’s harassment of a transgender woman, the Human Rights
                    Commission of Mongolia submitted a formal request to the police to investigate the incident under
                    the new criminal code.Mongolian police is investigating the case as a hate crime and, in late
                    September, they brought formal charges against Bosoo Khukh Mongol leader, Gankhuyag Ganzorig. They
                    have not taken action against the TV station. The woman, who prefers to remain anonymous, has worked
                    with the police and is being treated as a victim, a sign of progress as historically, rape and
                    sexual violence against Mongolia’s LGBT community have not been prosecuted.</p>

                <h2 class="ctr">South Korea decriminalization of adultery</h2>
                <p class="pd5px">The Constitutional Court of South Korea has abolished the crime of adultery,
                    emphasizing that the law, established 62 years ago to prohibit extramarital relationships,
                    suppresses personal freedoms.</p>
                <p class="pd5px">On February 26 2015, the Constitutional Court of Seoul repealed the South Korean law
                    against adultery, because according to the judges, it violates personal freedom. This law was
                    enacted in 1953 and provided - upon request of the betrayed spouse - up to two years in prison for
                    those found guilty of having had a consensual relationship outside of marriage. Since 1985, when
                    electronic records of the Supreme Prosecutor's Office were established, about 53,000 South Korean
                    citizens have been indicted and more than 35,000 have been imprisoned for adultery. However, in
                    recent times, the enforcement of this law had been greatly diminished: out of 892 indicted last
                    year, none were imprisoned and most cases ended with a financial settlement.</p>
                <p class="pd5px">"It is realistically impossible to criminally prosecute all unethical behaviors," said
                    the president of the Constitutional Court of Seoul reading the verdict.</p>
                <p class="pd5px">This ruling could generate protests from the more conservative part of the population,
                    convinced that the anti-adultery law served to protect traditional family values. In a survey in
                    2014, 60 percent of South Koreans surveyed responded that adultery should be legally punished, but
                    63 percent opposed imprisonment. Only 9 percent argued that infidelity should not concern the
                    judicial system.</p>
