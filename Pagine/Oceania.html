                    The Disability Discrimination Act 1992 (DDA) makes it unlawful to discriminate against a person, in
                    many areas of public life, including: employment, education, getting or using services, renting or
                    buying a house or unit, and accessing public places, because of their disability. The DDA covers
                    people who have temporary and permanent disabilities; physical, intellectual, sensory, neurological,
                    learning and psychosocial disabilities, diseases or illnesses, physical disfigurement, medical

                    The Age Discrimination Act 2004 (ADA) prohibits discrimination in employment on the basis of age. It

                    discrimination in other areas of public life, including education; getting or using services; or
                    renting or buying a house or unit.

                    The Act protects people from unfair treatment on the basis of their sex, sexual orientation, gender
                    identity, intersex status, marital or relationship status, pregnancy and breastfeeding. It also
                    protects workers with family responsibilities and makes sexual harassment against the law.

                <p class="pd5px">The New Zealand parliament on Tuesday passed almost unanimously a new law that will ban
                    conversion therapy for sexual orientation and gender identity or expression. The law will come into
                    force in six months and provides for up to three years in prison for those forces girls and boys,
                    minors or people who do not have decision-making autonomy to undergo conversion therapies. It
                    provides for up to five years in prison if the interventions have caused extremely serious damage,
