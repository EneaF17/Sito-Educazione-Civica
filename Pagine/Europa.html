            <div>
                <h2 class="pd5px">Ancient Roots:</h2>
                <p class="pd5px">Greece and Rome: Ancient Greek philosophers like Plato and Aristotle explored concepts of justice,
                    equality, and the rights of citizens. In Athens, the birthplace of democracy, discussions on
                    individual rights emerged, although they were often limited to male citizens. Similarly, Roman law
                    recognized certain legal protections for citizens, laying early foundations for concepts of rights
                    and responsibilities.</p>
                <h2 class="pd5px">Medieval Europe:</h2>
                <p class="pd5px">Feudalism and Monarchical Rule: During the Middle Ages, Europe was characterized by feudal societies
                    where power was concentrated in the hands of monarchs, feudal lords, and the church. Rights were
                    often tied to social status, with peasants having few protections. However, emerging legal
                    principles, such as the Magna Carta in 1215 in England, began to establish the idea of limits on the
                    power of rulers and the protection of certain rights for subjects. </p>
                <h2 class="pd5px">Renaissance and Enlightenment:</h2>
                <ol class="pd5px">
                    <li>Resurgence of Ideas: The Renaissance witnessed a revival of classical learning and humanist
                        thought, fostering a renewed interest in individualism and human dignity. This was further
                        developed during the Enlightenment, with thinkers like John Locke, Montesquieu, and Voltaire
                        advocating for natural rights, liberty, and the social contract theory.</li>
                    <li>Legal and Political Developments: The Enlightenment laid the groundwork for the codification of
                        rights in legal documents and political constitutions. The American Revolution in 1776 and the
                        French Revolution in 1789 were watershed moments, leading to the adoption of the U.S. Bill of
                        Rights and the French Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen, respectively.</li>
                </ol>
                <h2 class="pd5px">19th Century:</h2>
                <ol class="pd5px">
                    <li>Codification of Rights: Throughout the 19th century, various European countries began to enact
                        legal reforms and establish constitutional protections for citizens' rights. This period saw the
                        emergence of liberal democracies and the expansion of suffrage rights, albeit often limited to
                        certain social groups.</li>
                    <li>Abolitionist Movement: The 19th century also witnessed movements for the abolition of slavery
                        and the slave trade, with European nations gradually outlawing these practices. This contributed
                        to the recognition of the inherent dignity and rights of all individuals, regardless of race or
                        ethnicity.</li>
                </ol>
                <h2 class="pd5px">20th Century:</h2>
                <ol class="pd5px">
                    <li>World Wars and International Cooperation: The devastation of World Wars I and II underscored the
                        need for international cooperation and the protection of human rights. The League of Nations,
                        formed after World War I, and later the United Nations, established mechanisms for promoting and
                        protecting human rights globally.</li>
                    <li>Universal Declaration of Human Rights: The Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR) in 1948,
                        adopted by the UN General Assembly, is a landmark document affirming the fundamental rights and
                        freedoms of all people. It served as the basis for subsequent human rights treaties and
                        conventions.</li>
                </ol>
                <h2 class="pd5px">Post-War Europe:</h2>
                <ol class="pd5px">
                    <li>European Convention on Human Rights: The aftermath of World War II saw the establishment of the
                        European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR) in 1950, which created the European Court of Human
                        Rights. The Council of Europe oversees the ECHR and promotes human rights, democracy, and the
                        rule of law across its member states.</li>
                    <li>European Union: The European Union (EU), formed in the aftermath of World War II, has
                        increasingly incorporated human rights into its legal framework. The Charter of Fundamental
                        Rights of the European Union, adopted in 2000 and legally binding since the Lisbon Treaty in
                        2009, outlines a wide range of civil, political, economic, and social rights for EU citizens.

                </ol>
                <h2 class="pd5px">Contemporary Challenges:</h2>
                <ol class="pd5px">
                    <li>Immigration and Refugee Rights: Europe faces challenges related to immigration and refugee
                        rights, with debates over asylum policies, migrant integration, and humanitarian concerns.</li>
                    <li>Equality and Discrimination: Issues of discrimination based on race, gender, sexual orientation,
                        religion, and other factors persist in European societies, prompting efforts to promote equality
                        and combat prejudice.</li>
                    <li>Security vs. Civil Liberties: Balancing national security interests with the protection of civil
                        liberties remains a contentious issue, particularly in the context of counterterrorism measures
                        and surveillance practices.</li>
                    <li>Emerging Technologies: The advent of digital technologies presents new challenges to privacy
                        rights and freedom of expression, requiring adaptations of legal frameworks to safeguard
                        individuals' rights in the digital age.</li>
                </ol>

                <p class="pd5px">A new important emerging right throughout the world has been the legalization of same-sex marriage.
                    In Malta this has been possible since the 1st of September 2017 becoming the thirteenth state in
                    Europe to provide this right, whilst civil union has been available since 2014, marriage (which is
                    recognised by the federal government) had to wait for another 3 years. In 2006 only 18% of the Malta
                    population support same sex marriage, in 2012 41%, in 2016 61%, in 2023 74%. In 17 years there was
                    an increase of 56%.</p>
